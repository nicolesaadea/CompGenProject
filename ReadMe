CompGenProject
==============

Overview:
This repository contains implementations and tools for data deduplication, frequency tracking, and performance evaluation. The project is organized into folders for implementations, testing, profiling, and data.

Folder Structure:
-----------------
- Implementations
  - CountingCuckooFilter.py: Tracks membership and frequency.
  - CountMinSketch.py: Estimates item frequencies with low memory usage.
  - CuckooFilter.py: Probabilistic membership testing.
  - CuckooFilterWithCMS.py: Combines Cuckoo Filter and Count-Min Sketch.
  - EnhancedKMerTracker.py: Tracks k-mers efficiently using hybrid methods.
  - KMerTracker.py: Tracks k-mers with separate data structures.

- Testers
  - Tests basic functionality of all implementations (insert, lookup, delete, frequency tracking).
    - CountingCuckooFilterTester.py
    - CountMinSketchTester.py
    - CuckooFilterTester.py
    - CuckooFilterWithCMSTester.py
    - EnhancedKMerTrackerTester.py
    - KMerTrackerTester.py

- Profiling
  - Benchmarks memory, speed, and accuracy of implementations.
  - Scripts:
    - CuckooProfiler.py
  - Tools:
    - NgsReadsTreatment_v1.3.jar: Java tool for preprocessing genomic data (used for comparison).

- ProfilingData
